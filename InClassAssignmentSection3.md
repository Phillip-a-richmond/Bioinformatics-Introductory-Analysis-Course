## In Class Assignment Section 3: Exploring Linux/Unix

>This section will focus on the basic operations that you will use in the linux/unix environment, all run from the terminal.

### Part I (pwd, ls, man, touch, cd, mkdir, mv, rm)

1. Login to Orcinus.   What is the name of your home directory?
2. Within your home directory, make a directory called: TypesOfWine
3. Change into the directory that you just created.
4. Make a new directory inside of TypesOfWine called: Reds
5. Make another directory inside of TypesOfWine called: Whites
6. Change into the Whites directory, and make a file called: Cabarnet_Sauvignon
7. Wait a minute, the spelling doesn't seem right here.  Change the name of the file to be: Cabernet_Sauvignon
8. It takes a real fool to think that this is a type of white wine.  Move this file into the Reds directory.
9. Go back to your home directory, and list out all the files in a recursive manner (hint: man ls).
10. Change into the /global/scratch/WRC/ directory.
11. Make a directory with your last name as the directory's name.
12. Change into the TypesOfWine directory in the /global/scratch/WRC/ parent directory. 
13. Create a new file titled: \<lastname\>_\<typeOfWine\>.txt.  Make sure you don't reuse a type of wine that someone else has already listed  (Note: When you see me use characters like this, I want you to replace what's in the <> with your own information, ex: Richmond_Malbec.txt)
14. It's bad practice to have the same directory names in multiple places.  Go back to your home directory and change the name of your TypesOfWine directory to: Types_of_Wine

### Part II (cat, more, less, head, tail, sort, cut, paste, grep, chmod, history)
15.
