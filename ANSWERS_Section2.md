### Part I
1. List out all compute servers are available for you to login as a member of WestGrid (witout special access).
2. How many CPUs does each of these compute servers have?
3. Where is each of these servers hosted?
4. What is the command that you enter in the terminal to login to each of these compute servers?
+ Bugaboo
  + 4584 CPUs
  + SFU
  + ssh richmonp@bugaboo.westgrid.ca
+ Orcinus
  + 9600 CPUs
  + UBC :)
  + ssh richmonp@orcinus.westgrid.ca
+ Grex
  + 3792 CPUs
  + University of Manitoba
  + ssh richmonp@grex.westgrid.ca
+ Hermes
  + 2112 CPUs
  + University of Victoria
  + ssh richmonp@hermes.westgrid.ca
+ Nestor
  + 2304 CPUs
  + University of Victoria
  + ssh richmonp@nestor.westgrid.ca
+ Jasper
  + 4160 CPUs
  + University of Alberta
  + ssh richmonp@jasper.westgrid.ca
  
### Part II
1. List out the compute servers that you must have special permissions to access.
2. What is so special about these servers? (hint, look at the quickstart guide and system technical specifications)
3. What is the data storage/backup server, and how much disk-space storage is there?

+ Hungabee
+ Lattice
+ Parallel
+ Breezy

These servers usually have special software installed, or have high-memory capabilities not available on the other compute servers. 

Silo is the data storage/backup server, and it has 4.2 PB raw storage, 3.15 PB usable storage.
