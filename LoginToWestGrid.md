Throughout the course we will be using WestGrid for our computational needs.  This gives us access to much more computational power than if we were to use only our local macines.
+ In order to get started, you must have an account on WestGrid.  If you don't, click [here](https://www.westgrid.ca/support/accounts/getting_account), and realize that this process can take a few days to complete.
+ Once you have an account, you can login to one of these servers:
  + https://www.westgrid.ca//support/quickstart/new_users#choosing_system
  + ssh username@server.westgrid.ca
  + ssh richmonp@orcinus.westgrid.ca
  
And that's it!  Remember that while you have access to all these different servers, the type of work you're doing may require you to use a specific server due to the memory and processers available on each server.
