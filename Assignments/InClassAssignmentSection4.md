## In Class Assignment Section 4: Advanced Linux/Unix

>This section will focus on the basic operations that you will use in the linux/unix environment, all run from the terminal.

### Part I (wget, file compression, scp)
1. Make an Assignment 4 directory in /global/scratch/WRC/ called \<LastName\>_Assignment4
2. Go to the SGD website (www.yeastgenome.org), go to Sequence --> Download --> Then scroll down and select a wine strain, and download the .fsa and .gff files into your Assignment 4 directory for this strain.
3. Unzip the files you just downloaded, but make sure you keep a copy of the original, zipped, downloaded file (hint, man gunzip, or ask the internet)
4. What is the size of the files in their compressed format?  What about the size of the files?
5. How many chromosomes or contigs are there in your strain's assembly?
6. How many genes are there in this annotation set?
7. Fix the annotation gff file in the same fashion as we did the S288c.gff in the Assignment 3 problemset, and save it as \<strain\>_fixed.gff
8. Copy this fixed file to the desktop on your computer.


### Part II (File editing)

1. We need to document where we were getting these files from, so create a README.txt in your Assignment 4 directory, and use a text editor (emacs, vi, nano) to document where you got the file from, and include the date at which it was acquired.
2. Open a new file called: FeedbackLinuxIntroduction.txt
3. Within this file, write a comment or two about how you feel about the course so far.  Include any suggestions, comments about the pace of the course, content we are missing, videos that are hard to comprehend/follow, the need more randomly inserted jokes and puns, etc.
4. Download this file to your local computer, and email it to Phil at:
